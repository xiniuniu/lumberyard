// Description : Defines code coverage check points
//               and a central class to track their registration

/**
* Design notes:
*   See the CodeCoverageManager class that acts as the high-level API to the system
*   A (separate) tracking GUI is crucial to this system - an efficient interface to service this is not trivial
*
* Technical notes:
*   The manager would appear to lend itself to a map of names to checkpoint pointers for quick lookup
*   However I really want to keep overhead to a minimum even in registering and I guess we might have 1000 CCCPoints
*   A vector, with some sorting or heapifying might be better when the code matures
