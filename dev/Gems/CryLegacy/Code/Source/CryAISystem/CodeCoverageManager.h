// Description : High-level manager class for code coverage system
//               including file handing of checkpoint lisst
//               Tracks whether key points of code have been hit in testing

/**
* Design notes:
*   For now, reading contexts is done in one shot. I'm tempted to work through the file slowly to avoid a spike.
*   A (separate) tracking GUI is crucial to this system - an efficient interface to service this is not trivial
*   Quite a basic principle to underlie this code is that we're only interested in checkpoints we haven't yet hit
