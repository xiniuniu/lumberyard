     * Class to provide extra functionality for working with QSpinBox objects.
     *
     * The SpinBox class provides the ability to connect to a signal for when the
     * value being modified is committed. Similar to how a QLineEdit control has a
     * signal for editingFinished, you can connect to SpinBox::valueChangeEnded, which
     * will be called consistently, regardless of if the value changes as a result of
     * a text change by the user, the mouse wheel turning, the up and down arrow keys or
     * the up and down buttons being clicked.
     *
     * This control also has signals for undo and redo, that can be overridden in the
     * case that a global, or external, undo/redo system should be used.
     * If the lineEdit is being edited (meaning the current text hasn't been committed
     * and the editingFinished signal hasn't been emitted) then the lineEdit's
     * internal undo stack will be used. If the value is committed, and the lineEdit's
     * undo stack is clear, then the signals will be emitted for globalUndoTriggered
     * and globalRedoTriggered.
     * To set the enabled state of the undo and redo right click context menu items,
     * connect to the contextMenuAboutToShow signal and set the state of the parameter
     * actions.
     *
     * This control also changes the cursor to indicate, around the edges of the
     * control, that a left mouse button press and drag to the left or right will
     * change the value.
     *
     * SpinBox controls are styled in SpinBox.qss and configured in SpinBoxConfig.ini
