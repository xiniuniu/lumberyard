             * Class to handle two different cases which sound the same:
             *
             * Case 1 - threads that block waiting on a particular asset to finish
             *   (via AssetManager::Instance().GetAsset(..., loadBlocking==true);
             * Case 2 - assets that only get processed on a specific (usually the main) thread
             *   and therefore block their loading jobs until the specific thread
             *   runs and clears them
             *
             * Case 2 doesn't generally cause any problems... unless one of those jobs
             * is running and someone triggers a Case 1. In that case, GetAsset()
             * will sit and spin waiting for it's load to complete, but it never will
             * because it's blocking the very thread that would clear up any jobs
             * blocking on that thread.
             *
             * LegacyBlockingAssetTypeManager solves that problem by allowing AssetHandlers
             * to run ProcessQueuedAssetRequests when it detects both cases in play.
             * 
             * It uses concurrent_vector so that memory is never freed accidentally
             * when mucking with our lists.
