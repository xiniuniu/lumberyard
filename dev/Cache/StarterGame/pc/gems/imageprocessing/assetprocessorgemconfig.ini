; ---- add any metadata file type here that needs to be monitored by the AssetProcessor.
; Modifying these meta file will cause the source asset to re-compile again.
; They are specified in the following format
; metadata extension=original extension to replace
; if the metadata extension does not replace the original, then the original can be blank
; so for example if your normal file is blah.tif and your metafile for that file is blah.tif.exportsettings
; then your declaration would be exportsettings=   ; ie, it would be blank
; however if your metafile REPLACES the extension (for example, if you have the file blah.i_caf and its metafile is blah.exportsettings)
; then you specify the original extension here to narrow the scope.
; If a relative path to a specific file is provided instead of an extension, a change to the file will change all files
; with the associated extension (e.g. Animations/SkeletonList.xml=i_caf will cause all i_caf files to recompile when 
; Animations/SkeletonList.xml within the current game project changes)
